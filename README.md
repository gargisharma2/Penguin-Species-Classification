# Penguin Species Classification
This project involves building a classification model to identify penguin species based on physical characteristics such as bill length, flipper length, and body mass.

# Dataset
# Dataset: 
Palmer Penguins dataset
Contains measurements for three species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.
# Objective
To develop a machine learning model to accurately classify penguin species based on physical traits.

# Steps Involved
✅ Data cleaning and handling missing values
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends
✅ Feature selection and scaling
✅ Model development and training using classification algorithms
✅ Model evaluation using accuracy and precision
✅ Data visualization using Tableau/Power BI

# Results
Achieved high accuracy in predicting penguin species.
Identified key features influencing classification.
Presented findings through interactive visualizations.
